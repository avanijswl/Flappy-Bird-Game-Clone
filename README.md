# Flappy-Bird-Game-Clone

Hello all!
It's been a few weeks since I shared my last project.
But this time, I tried something new, something that's easy to begin with, can be completed as a project and gives off a nostalgic game vibe.
This time, I tried to build a "Flappy Bird Game Clone".
I got this idea from Codedex website's Project : "Build a Flappy Bird Clone With Phaser" by "David Verghese".
Here's the link for the instructions and code guidance: https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-flappy-bird-clone-with-phaser

Till then enjoy my little game that I build using mainly JavaScript and a little bit of HTML.
Software I used: VS Code ( Use Live Server / Go live extension).
For next project I'll keep you updated!!
Until then, bye!!
